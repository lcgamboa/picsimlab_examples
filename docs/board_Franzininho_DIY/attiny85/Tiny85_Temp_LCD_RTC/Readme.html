  <h1> Example Tiny85 Temp LCD RTC of TinyWireM library</h1>
<br>
<br>
<pre>
ATtiny85 as an I2C Master   Ex3        BroHogan                         1/22/11
I2C master reading DS1621 temperature sensor & DS1307 RTC. Display to I2C GPIO LED.
SETUP:
ATtiny Pin 1 = (RESET) N/U                      ATtiny Pin 2 = (D3) N/U
ATtiny Pin 3 = (D4) to LED1                     ATtiny Pin 4 = GND
ATtiny Pin 5 = SDA on all devices               ATtiny Pin 6 = (D1) to LED2
ATtiny Pin 7 = SCK on all devices               ATtiny Pin 8 = VCC (2.7-5.5V)
NOTE! - It's very important to use pullups on the SDA & SCL lines!
DS1621 wired per data sheet. This ex assumes A0-A2 are set LOW for an addeess of 0x48
DS1307 wired per data sheet. This ex assumes A0-A2 are set LOW for an addeess of 0x68
PCA8574A GPIO was used wired per instructions in "info" folder in the LiquidCrystal_I2C lib.
This ex assumes A0-A2 are set HIGH for an addeess of 0x3F
LiquidCrystal_I2C lib was modified for ATtiny - on Playground with TinyWireM lib.
TinyWireM USAGE & CREDITS: - see TinyWireM.h
