  <h1> MPU6050 and 3D cube </h1>
<br>
Time to rotate a virtual cube on a 0.96″ OLED Display! In this tutorial, I’ll be using the MPU6050 to get the acceleration values of the X-axis and the Y-Axis, which would then be translated to the speed at which the cube is rotating at. I’ll not be using the values of the gyroscope this time but I may used it in the future.
