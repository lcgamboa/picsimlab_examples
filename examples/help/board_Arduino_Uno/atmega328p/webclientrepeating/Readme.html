  <h1> library Ethernet example: WebClientRepeating  </h1>
<pre>
  Repeating Web client
 This sketch connects to a a web server and makes a request
 using a Wiznet Ethernet shield. You can use the Arduino Ethernet shield, or
 the Adafruit Ethernet shield, either one will work, as long as it's got
 a Wiznet Ethernet module on board.
 This example uses DNS, by assigning the Ethernet client with a MAC address,
 IP address, and DNS address.
 Circuit:
 * Ethernet shield attached to pins 10, 11, 12, 13
