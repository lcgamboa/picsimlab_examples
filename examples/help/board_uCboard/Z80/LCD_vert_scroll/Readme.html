;
; Program: v_scroll.asm
; programmer(s): Dincer Aydin (dinceraydin@altavista.net)
; function: vertical scroll effect
; The effect is the same as the one you can see at the entrance of my LCD pages:
; http://www.dinceraydin.com/lcd/z80example.htm
;
;
; This code requires a 2*16 LCD connected to a 8255 with base address of 00h
; routines sendcomA & sendcom & sendcharA & sendchar have been tested on 
; >> 2*16 Hitachi LCD with HD44780 chip 
; >> Samsung 1*16 LCD with a KS0062F00 chip
; >> 2*16 Epson LCD marked P300020400 SANTIS 1 ,and 
; >> noname 1*16 HD44780 based LCD.
; The Z80 was clocked at 2 MHz and 4,9152 MHz for each display.This was done 
; because the routines mentioned above take many t states and in most cases 
; that will be longer that the time a HD44780 will need to execute a command. 
;
; Connections:
; LCD data bus(pins #14-#7) connected to Port A of a 8255 with 00h base address
; LCD Enable pin(#6) connected to Port C bit #7
; LCD R/W pin(#5) connected to Port C bit #6
; LCD RS pin(#4) connected to Port C bit #5
